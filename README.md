# Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Chatbots
After creating the chatbot, present it in the GUI instead of the terminal.

## Usage
* In the main.py file, you can customize the GUI to your preference, including font selection and shape sizes. When a user sends a message, the bot responds with a message in return. 
* You can integrate the bot with your own language models (BERT, Customized Chatbot, etc.).
